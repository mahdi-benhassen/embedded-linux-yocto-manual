 \chapter{Building Applications with Yocto}
 \section{Build Systems}
 Yocto supports autotools, CMake, and Meson through classes. Select the appropriate class and set variables to locate sources and control configuration options.
 \section{CMake Example}
 Write a recipe that inherits cmake and installs a binary to bindir.
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 cat > ../meta-hello/recipes-example/cmake-hello/cmake-hello.bb << 'EOF'
 SUMMARY = "CMake hello"
 LICENSE = "MIT"
 LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE;md5=3b83ef96387f14655fc854ddc3c6bd57"
 SRC_URI = "git://example.com/cmake-hello.git;branch=main"
 S = "${WORKDIR}/git"
 inherit cmake
 do_install() {
     install -d ${D}${bindir}
     install -m 0755 hello ${D}${bindir}/hello
 }
 EOF
 \end{lstlisting}
 \section{Runtime Dependencies}
 Declare RDEPENDS for runtime libraries and tools needed by the application. Use PACKAGES and FILES variables to control package splitting and contents.
 \section{QA}
 Address QA warnings and errors raised by insane.bbclass by ensuring proper file ownership, permissions, and correct library paths.
