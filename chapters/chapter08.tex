 \chapter{Debugging and Profiling}
 \section{Observability}
 Instrument the system with logs, dmesg, and journald. Use strace to inspect syscalls, ltrace for library calls, and perf for performance analysis.
 \section{gdbserver}
 Run gdbserver on the target and connect from the host with the cross-gdb for your architecture.
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 ssh user@board-ip gdbserver :1234 /usr/bin/your-app
 arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb your-app
 (gdb) target remote board-ip:1234
 \end{lstlisting}
 \section{Tracing}
 Analyze application behavior and kernel events using perf and ftrace. Capture hot paths and use flamegraphs to visualize CPU usage where applicable.
 \section{Hands-On: strace}
 Observe file operations and networking calls to identify failures in configuration or runtime dependencies.
