 \chapter{Layers and Customization}
 \section{Layer Design}
 Organize metadata by functionality and hardware. Keep BSP, distro configuration, and application recipes in separate layers. Use priority and compatibility fields to control overrides.
 \section{Configuration}
 Customize local.conf for parallelism, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR, and MACHINE. Configure DISTRO features and IMAGE features to include services and packages.
 \section{bbappend}
 Use .bbappend files to modify upstream recipes without forking. Override variables, add patches, or adjust tasks. Ensure layer priority allows the intended override.
 \section{Hands-On: Custom Image}
 Create a custom image recipe that extends core-image-base and adds your application package and system services. Build and deploy to the target.
