 \chapter{Reproducibility, CI, and Release}
 \section{State and Mirrors}
 Control DL_DIR and SSTATE_DIR to cache downloads and shared state. Use sstate mirrors to accelerate rebuilds and ensure consistent artifacts across development machines and CI nodes.
 \section{Reproducible Builds}
 Pin layers and branches, use fixed SRCREV values for git sources, and avoid floating dependencies. Record build metadata and manifests to support repeat runs and auditing.
 \section{Licensing}
 Ensure all recipes include license declarations and checksums. Collect license reports and artifacts for compliance and distribution.
 \section{CI Integration}
 Automate builds using containers or dedicated build hosts. Run bitbake in clean workspaces and publish artifacts with integrity checks. Incorporate QA gates and image tests to validate releases.
